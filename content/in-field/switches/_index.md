## Overview

Switches are selection controls that yield instantaneous actions. They have an on and off setting.

## Usage

**When to use**

+ Turning on and off a feature, mode, or functionality.

+ Toggling elicits a change in the UI.  

+ You want to trigger a state change directly when you toggle it.

**When not to use**

- Requiring user action consent, such as accepting terms and conditions.
  Instead, use a Checkbox.  

- Requesting multiple choices from a group of options. Instead, use a 
  Checkbox group.  

- Users need to select one item from a list of options. Instead, use a Radio Button.Â

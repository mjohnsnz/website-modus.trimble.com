## Accessibility

The Buttons:

- Disabled buttons should have aria-disabled set to true.
- When placing a button on a color other than standard background colors (Gray         Light or White), make sure the colors of all states (except for disabled) still     meet color contrast accessibility standards.[color contrast accessibility     
  standards](/foundations/accessibility/).
